# Odhecaton

One of my passions is playing chamber music and [IMSLP.org](http://imslp.org) has the best collection of musical scores online. However, their website is not optimized for mobile devices.

I wrote this app to teach myself AngularJS and also to provide a better way to access the great music collection at IMSLP. This app uses REST/JSONP to access IMSLP data using the [MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org).

The name Odhecaton is from 'Harmonice Musices Odhecaton' by Ottaviano Petrucci, the first musical score published with movable type. The IMSLP collection is also called the [Petrucci Music Library](http://localhost:8080/wiki/IMSLP:About).
